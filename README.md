# Kisan Bhartiya
* I came up with the idea for a startup called Kisan Bhartiya, which will focus on providing IoT-based solutions to help farmers increase their yield and optimize their resources.

* Our platform will offer an e-commerce marketplace for farmers to buy and sell their produce, as well as access to expert advice and industry insights.

* We will empower farmers and rural communities by providing them with the tools and resources they need to succeed.

* Our aim is to connect farmers directly with consumers, providing a platform for them to interact and trade their produce.

* We will offer logistical support, such as transportation and storage solutions, to help farmers get their produce to consumers in a timely and efficient manner.

* Consumers will benefit from access to fresh, locally sourced produce at competitive prices, while also supporting sustainable and responsible farming practices.

* Our revenue model will be based on taking a commission on sales made through the platform, as well as charging a subscription fee to farmers for access to our IoT and advisory services.

* We will build a brand that emphasizes the importance of supporting local farmers and sustainable agriculture practices, and leverage social media to showcase the stories of farmers and their produce, as well as to promote the platform to consumers.

* We will also partner with local restaurants and chefs to showcase the produce available on the platform and build awareness among consumers.

* Our ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on the lives of farmers and rural communities, while also providing consumers with access to healthy and sustainable food options.

Before Kisan Bhartiya, I developed an application called Kisan Aadhaar as my diploma final year project. It was designed to scrape agriculture-based news from the Economic Times and display it on the home page in the form of vertically scrollable cards. I used flutter SDK to build this application.
