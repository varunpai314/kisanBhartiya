# Kisan Bhartiya
Kisan Bhartiya is an agriculture-focused startup that is dedicated to empowering farmers and rural communities. In the near future, we will be launching IoT-based solutions to help farmers increase their yield and optimize their resources. Our platform will include an e-commerce marketplace where farmers can easily buy and sell their produce, while also gaining access to expert advice and industry insights.

As we move forward, we will strive to provide consumers with access to fresh, locally sourced produce at competitive prices, while also supporting sustainable and responsible farming practices. By bridging the gap between farmers and consumers, we aim to create a more transparent and equitable food system that benefits everyone involved.

Through our innovative approach and commitment to using cutting-edge technology, we are confident that Kisan Bhartiya will revolutionize the agriculture industry in India and beyond.
Before Kisan Bhartiya, I developed an application called Kisan Aadhaar as my diploma final year project. It was designed to scrape agriculture-based news from the Economic Times and display it on the home page in the form of vertically scrollable cards. I used flutter SDK to build this application.
